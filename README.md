# Hello, I am MarcosMD09

- I am creating a system named **Windroid**.
- I live in **Cuba**, in the province of **Artemisa**.
- I can program in ``Lua``, ``Java``, ``JavaScript`` and ``TypeScript``.

## Lua Example:
```lua
local a,b,c = 0
io.write("Input one number: ")
a = io.read()
io.write("\nInput other number: ")
b = io.read()
c = a + b
io.write("The sum of "..a.." and "..b.." is "..c..".")
```
## JavaScript Example:
```javascript
var a = prompt("Imput one number: ");
var b = prompt("Input other number: ");
var c = a + b;
window.alert("The sum of "+ a +" and "+ b +" is "+ c +".");
```
